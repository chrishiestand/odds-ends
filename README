* apache-log-correlate: time correlates apache requests (logged in a custom format) across multiple log files.  
  The goal being that if something happens to your server at 3:54:30 AM, you can use this to quickly scan every 
  log file to see which files were being accessed. 
* pathto: a somewhat wonky replacement for realpath, if realpath is not available
* ssh-key-wipe: quickly erase all the ssh host keys in your known-hosts file for a given fully qualified hostname.
